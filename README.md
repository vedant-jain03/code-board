## Inspiration 🧑‍🎨
Teachers are always making learning easier for students so that they can excel, but sometimes it becomes tough while explaining a code, where the problem can have multiple code solutions from brute force to optimal trade offs, and also difficult for students to ask doubts on a particular line of code to why a particular line is written, A platform where the coding and interaction can be made easier and fun is much needed.

| Doubt Section |

* The editing code feature can be handled both by Teacher and students so that student can also give the input and can make the code optimal.
* Ask a doubt in doubt section would let teacher know on which line the student has a doubt.
* We have designed our code collab page in such a way that its convinient for teachers as well as students to learn and ask their doubts.

* Students just need to enter the Code Room Unique Id Shared by their Teachers and can get in and learn without any hindrance.

* All the joinies will get alert toaster regarding events like joining of a new member or someone asked a doubt, so that everyone can see what is happening!

## How we built it 🚧

- We used ReactJS for the website.
- We use CodeMirror library to integrate the code editor.
- We use socket.io for real-time changes in a room.
- We use Express.js to build our backend server.
- We used Figma to make the designs for the website.
- We used heroku for the deployement.

## What's next for CodeBoard 🧑‍💻
* Adding Test Cases features with quick compilation so that a Teacher can add test cases and can better judge student's code.
* TImer with different themes of editors, making coding fun for everyone.
